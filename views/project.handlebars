    <h5>Inspiration</h5>
		<p>This sound visualizer is inspired by two things, the shape of the ribbon used in rhythmic gymnastics and the phenomenal of synesthesia, which means one sense can lead to another. I find the ribbon elegant and aesthetically pleasing, and it resembles the sound wave in nature.</p>

    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>For the spectrum and waterfall plot,I calculate the peak frequency of each input wave by applying FFT and use it to distinguish notes and find their approximate music scales. If a frequency is close enough to a chromatic scale within the limit defined by the epsilon, the corresponding music scale and the frequency will "pop up" in the center of the screen. The most fun and challenging part is to color the chromatic scale based on this "color of sound" formular found <a href="http://www.flutopedia.com/sound_color.htm">here</a>. Note that although each color corresponds to one scale, I actually use it to represent a range of frequencies separated by the midpoint of two scales so that the plot looks more smooth and continuous. This visualizer also mimics the experience of synesthesia by associating each chromatic scale with a color. I hope you enjoy this visualizer!</p>
